# Love
1. 'Regret Reprise', `You fell in love with me when I started to fall too,But with my mind clouded, I thought you loved another, I hadn\'t a clue,But you didn\'t love him at all, but it was far too late,For I had already pushed these overdue feelings away,I started seeing another, alongside you on my mind,The more we talked, the more I found you were quite hard to find,When my late love silently broke my heart,My original feelings for you came back just as they did from the start,But when my feelings for you started to feel like fate,Your heart for me had ceased, for I was simply far too late,Now as I sit in silence of my regret,I find it hard to keep this unreciprocted love, a secret.`

2. 'Entwined', `amidst faith's bloom where shadows cease, in life's embrace, a love finds peace, through Jesus' grace, two hearts combine, In sacred light, their spirits entwine, beyond lifes trials and storms that roar, He stands like a lighthouse on the shore,In his embrace all fears subsideloves endless flow, a constant tide, not bound by time, nor worldly view, A love eternal, pure and true, Through Jesus' eyes,hearts clearly see,a love unending, forever free`

3. 'Perfect Design', `Jesus became a carpenter knowing one day he would be nailed to a cross, God created roses with thorns knowing one day they would be crowned on the head of his only son, He never makes a mistake or imprefect design, so why should you feel so different about yourself?`

4. 'Gaze of Grace', `In the gaze of grace, love takes it's flight,\nEyes fixed on the Lord, a beam of light,\nA selfless embrace, like His presence so true,\nIn His reflection, we learn to love too.`
5. 'Regarding the Heart', `For in regards to the heart, we can\' control the tides,\nAnd though I love her with all I am, my heart still has abides,\nBut I\'ll have to remind myself each day, though it\'s hard to bear,\nHer heart belongs to another, and I\'ll have to learn to share.`
6. 'Corridors', `Her smile, a beacon in my world, a treasure beyond compare, a melody so tender are rare,\nIn the corridors of my heart, a love so rich and deep resides,\nFor a girl, a cherished dream,\nIs where my affliction hides,\nBut the truth I must acknowledge, though it stings and bites,\nIs that she doesn't share these feellings,\nThroughout all these sleepless nights.`
7. 'Seeing Her', `I\'ve watched her from a distance, like the moon to distant seas,\nAdmired her in her beauty, like the leaves upon the trees,\nYet the love I hold so tightly, like a fragile glass,\nIs a love she doesn\'t mirror,\nA love that cannot last.`
